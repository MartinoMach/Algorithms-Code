/* PROBLEM 42
 *
 *
 * Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, 
 * compute how much water it can trap after raining.

 

	Example 1:
	
	
	Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
	Output: 6
	Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
	Example 2:
	
	Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
	Output: 9
